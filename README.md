# Hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hi, 
My name is Benjamin and I'm new on GitHub. I've been programming a little bit in high school, but that was 22 years ago on Turbo Pascal, so I can say I'm a newby in coding. 
I don't want to learn coding, but I need to practice some no-code / low-code in order to better hack and strap data on internet, to fuel my business dev system.
